<p>
Mt Caz is a renegade community arts space, built on the principle that we have abundant resources when we share those 
intangible parts of ourselves, like our creativity, our space, and our energy.
</p>
<p>
We are located in the ancestral lands of the Kalapuya People, in the small college city of Corvallis, OR. Bordered by 
the Willamette and Mary Rivers, forested hills, and rural lands, and peppered with parks and natural areas, the city 
has a vibrant integration of culture and natural beauty.
</p>
<p>
Mt Caz houses two long-term resident artists, <a href="http://www.kong.cat/">Albert Kong</a> and <a href="http://www.
    sodelightful.com/comics">Christina Tran</a>.To keep things dynamic and to promote the flow of energy, we also have 
    a short term residency program for artists and makers of all perspectives. We invite you to join us in our 
    guest room, share our resources for building, zinemaking, and gatherings, and to contribute to the growing 
    community with your creativity, experiences, and contemplation.
</p>
<p>
We value community. Mt Caz is committed to a flat society, to minimizing power and control. To that end we hope to 
    create a community in our space that is based on communication, distributed maintenance, measured sociability, 
    and group meals.
</p>
<p>
We value outward expression. Much of the work that happens here manifests in some way as a public performance or 
    exhibition for the community around us. We’ll work with you to think of ways that you can share your time here 
    publicly. If you’re not sure how to perform your work, that’s okay! We will work with you to figure it out.
</p>
<p>
As a general structure, you will stay in our guest room free of charge, or pay-what-you-want, for a three week period. 
    We’ll split grocery and utility costs between all of us. Hopefully, while you’re here we can help you produce an 
    event that reflects your work or your time here. We’ll do what we can to help you feel comfortable, and we’re 
    willing to discuss any of these details.
</p>
<p>
Let’s bring you home.
